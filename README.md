# 🌍 Global Superstore Tableau Dashboard Project

This project analyzes international sales, profitability, and customer behavior using the **Global Superstore dataset**. A comprehensive, interactive **Tableau dashboard** was created to explore performance metrics across countries, segments, categories, and shipping performance.

The dashboard empowers stakeholders to identify market trends, operational inefficiencies, and high-performing regions.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard provides insights into:

- 📦 Global sales, profit, and quantity trends  
- 🛒 Performance by product category and sub-category  
- 🌍 Regional and country-wise comparisons  
- 🧑‍💼 Customer segmentation and top buyers  
- 🚚 Shipping modes and delivery delays

## 🔍 Major Trends & Events

- 📉 **Negative Profit in High Sales Regions**: Countries like India and Australia showed high sales volumes but experienced consistent losses due to steep discounts and long ship times.
- 💸 **Discounted Orders Often Unprofitable**: A clear inverse correlation between discount percentage and profit margin highlighted pricing inefficiencies.
- 🚀 **Technology Outperformed All Other Categories**: Tech products had the highest average profit per unit, especially in North America and Europe.
- 🕐 **Standard Class Shipping Showed Highest Delays**: Standard Class had the largest number of late deliveries, affecting customer satisfaction and return rates.
- 💼 **Corporate Segment Was Most Profitable**: Despite fewer orders than consumers, the corporate customer segment generated the highest profit margins globally.
- 🔄 **Frequent Returns Linked to Furniture**: Furniture had a higher return rate and lower profit per unit across most countries.
